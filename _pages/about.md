Hello! I'm Tom, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Ghent 
investigating the stimuli-induced transition behaviour of hybrid frameworks. My
approach involves atomistic modelling of materials informed by total scattering 
experiments. My project is hosted by 
[Prof. Sven Rogge](https://molmod.ugent.be/members/sven-rogge) at the [Center for
Molecular Modelling](https://molmod.ugent.be).

I began my MChem degree at the University of Oxford in 2016. During the 
Summer of 2019, I was awarded a bursary for a research project at University 
College London, under the supervision of 
[Dr. Andrew Seel](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Dr-Andrew-Seel.aspx). During 
this project, I investigated the structure of metalâ€“ammonia solutions using 
neutron total scattering and structural modelling. Following this, I carried out 
my Master's degree project under the supervision of 
[Prof. Andrew Goodwin](https://goodwingroupox.uk) and
[Prof. Volker Deringer](https://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/people/volker-deringer). In 
this project, I explored combining machine-learning techniques with structural 
coarse-graining and atom-density-based descriptors to visualise and quantify 
structural diversity in MOFs.

In 2020, I began my PhD in the Department of Inorganic Chemistry at the 
University of Oxford, supervised by Prof. Andrew Goodwin and Prof. Volker 
Deringer. My thesis focused on characterising and understanding the microscopic
structure of amorphous materials.

During my PhD, I explored the modelling of amorphous materials by combining 
traditional refinement techniques, such as reverse Monte Carlo, with energy 
minimisations using state-of-the-art interatomic potentials. In this 'hybrid' 
way, it was possible to generate structural models that reproduce the
experimental data, but are also 'chemically sensible'. In the absence of any
suitable interatomic potential, I developed and used machine-learned potentials.
I then used these models to further our understanding of the amorphous forms,
typically using coarse-grained representations in order to focus on the key 
components driving the structural complexity.
